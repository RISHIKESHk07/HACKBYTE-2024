# Gesture-to-Keyboard Control System

This project implements a gesture-to-keyboard control system that allows users to interact with desktop applications using hand gestures. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize predefined hand gestures from a webcam feed and maps them to corresponding keyboard controls/actions.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Detects and localizes hand gestures from live video feed captured by a webcam.
- **Keyboard Control**: Converts recognized hand gestures into keyboard inputs to control desktop applications.
- **Customizable Gesture Mapping**: Allows users to define and customize mappings between hand gestures and keyboard controls/actions.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides visual or auditory feedback to users to indicate when a gesture has been recognized successfully.
- **Configuration Options**: Enables users to adjust recognition sensitivity and customize gesture-keyboard mappings through a settings interface.


## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
